# Video2Frame
A simple python script that will take the input video and convert it into multiple frames (image sequence) in the "frames_output" folder.

Just run "run.bat" or type "python video2frame.py" in the command line, then select the input video to be converted into an image sequence. 
The program will do its thing and convert all video frames into .jpg images.

If you are having problems running this:

You must have OpenCV installed!

pip install opencv-python
